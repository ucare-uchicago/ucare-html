<h1>Undergrad/Master Research in 
Cloud Computing, Operating/Storage Systems,
and/or Using Machine Learning for Systems (More Details)</h1>


More basic information and requirements are described below, in addition to what
has been stated in the first advertisement.


<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>

<p><li>Interested in analyzing, evaluating, and building large systems.

<p><li><u>Undergrad students:</u> Commit on average <b>10+ hours</b> per week,
and a minimum of <b>1 year</b> commitment, 2 years
if possible (see reasoning below)

<p><li><u>BSMS students:</u>
Commit on average <b>20+ hours</b> per week, and
a minimum of <b>9 months, including summer internship in our group</b> (strict requirement).
As an BSMS student, you are expected to finish a successful master thesis, hence
the long and hard commitment.

<p><li><u>MPCS students:</u> 
Commit on average <b>15+ hours</b> per week, and
a minimum of <b>9 months, including summer internship in our group</b> (strict requirement).
Note that the MPCS program allows academic internship to be used to fulfill your
internship requirement.
You also need to take <b>practicums both in Winter and Spring</b>.

<p><li>Consider classes related to cloud systems, data-intensive systems,
and operating systems (more below).

<p><li>Have positive characteristics: energetic, hard-working, determined, and
independent (seek solutions by oneself, a lot of self-learning, etc.).

<p><li>Focused.  You only take courses and do research, but nothing else
(side jobs, etc.).  In other words, prove that research is your high
priority.

<!--
<li>Interested in pursuing a Master/PhD degree in the near future 
(this project will equip you with research skills that will strengthen your
application for Master/PhD admission)
-->

</ul>


<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
The goal of this independent study is to give you a strong experience in
systems research, while at the same time, you will help us understand new
systems and produce new findings. If you are deeply committed, you will
gain a lot of experience.

<p>
One concrete end goal is publication.  If you get new results, we can write
a paper, and you will appear as one of the co-authors.  Having a
publication during your undergrad/ms study is typically considered a major
accomplishment.  If you want to go to grad school, having one or more
publications will greatly help your admission.

<p>I also suggest you
talk with 
<a href="http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/people.html">undergrad and MS students in my group</a> 
and ask about their experience.




<h2>Salary</h2>

<p>
Beginners in undergraduate/master research are typically <i>unpaid</i>.  In
general, students who apply here mainly have interests in gaining some
research skills as they want to build credentials to pursue a higher
degree (Master/PhD).  If you expect to be paid from the beginning, I'm
afraid to say that this is not a suitable position.

<p>
In few exceptional cases (the project goes well after one year),
salary can be arranged.  For example, some of our BS or MS students received
some fellowships or research assistantships.  But again there is no 
guarantee that there
will be salary support.


<h2>Commitment</h2>


<p>In terms of hours/week, I expect the student to commit a significant
amount of time as mentioned above.  I also expect a long term commitment as
stated above (more than one quarter).

<p>
Why the deep and long commitment?  This is because our group is <b>investing
our time</b> to advise you and equip you with research skills.  
I'll give you a real project worthy of
publication.  I will not give you a toy project. This means I
think hard every week on what you should be doing.  This is a big
time investment from the advisor's side.  Students who simply
wants to polish their resume with flashy research experience but
without committing time into it are basically wasting the
advisor's time. 

<P>I have supervised many grad and undergrad students and I have
witnessed myself that no matter how smart the student is, if
he/she could not commit a large amount of time, the project will
not go anywhere (no result, no publication, no impact).
Hence, I seriously consider time commitment as the most important
factor for success.

<p>You might also wonder whether it's a good idea to do research as a
"side thing" (e.g. you already have a part-time job elsewhere, or work
on a start-up, join many programming competititons, etc.).
Unfortunately, this won't work.  In fact I would suggest pick your
priority and do it best rather than being greedy in acquiring broad
experience with nothing deep.  Research cannot be a side thing. 


<h2>Undergraduate Credits</h2>


<p><i>For undergraduate students only</i>

<p>
If you are an undergraduate, you can register for CMSC 29700 Reading and
Research in Computer Science.  (If you don't want to pay for credits and just
want to get the research experience, I am okay with that too.)

<p>(I heard that the department will soon allow research credits to be
accounted towards major credits.  Please check with the department about this).



<h2>MPCS Practicum</h2>

<p><i>For MPCS students only</i>

<p>Some master students often wonder which one is better in shaping their
resume: take a research practicum or an extra class.  This is a complex
decision because you pay a high tuition and you want to get the best
knowledge and skills for your future career.  

<p>The answer to this question depends on what your future goal is.  All I
can provide here is one good reason why practicum can boost your resume.

<p>Here's the culture of research in my group.  I give students
open-ended interesting projects that touch modern systems (SSD,
Hadoop, etc.). With such projects, students get <i>deep, hands-on</i>
experience of using/modifying state-of-the-art systems.  Unlike course
projects, research projects don't have solutions ready in front of
you. It's a process.  You learn from this process, and this is
something you can share in your resume.  I know that some employers
find outside-class projects an important factor that tells if you have
the ability to start new projects or join existing big projects in the
real world.  The only tradeoff of doing practicum is that you take one less
class.  So, this is the question you need to ask yourself: Do you
want to learn more from one more class? Or, do you want to gain
knowledge and skills by exploring open-ended projects?  The answer 
depends on your future goal.  



<p>I sincerely hope that this process can help you find a good job.
My research relates with industry.  If you do great, I can write you a
great reference letter (see 
<a href="http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/people.html">many successful
MPCS students</a> who were part of our group.


<h2>Required Courses to Take:</h2>

<p><i>Topics in OS (CS 332) in Spring</i>

<p> I teach this course usually in the Winter quarter.  I require you to take
  this course because in this course,  you will get more time to
perform your research, as you can use your
research for the class project.  This course will also help you improve
your presentation skills.  You can use this course for your BSMS or MPCS
credits.    The course is open for both undergrads and grads. 


<h2>Recommended Courses:</h2>


<p><i>Undergrad OS (CS 230) or MPCS-level OS (MPCS 520)</i>

<p> This course is highly recommended.  Please plan to take this course
the next time it is available. 


<p><i>Advanced OS (CS 331) and Data-Intensive Computing (CS ??)</i>

<p>Taking advanced OS and data-intensive computing is optional.  But if
possible, try to take both of them.  If that is impossible, please
take at least one of them.  These are PhD-level courses that I believe
can be accounted to your credits.

<p>The Data-Intensive computing class has different names. Sometimes
it's called "cloud", sometimes it's called "Topics in Systems".  
The most recent faculty who teaches this course is Prof. Junchen Jiang. 
Please find this course in the syllabus.  It is basically about
cloud computing frameworks.

<p>My whole point in suggesting you these courses is two fold: First,
these courses give you a <i>breadth</i> of background of today's
technology and most of them relate to my practicum projects.  Second,
these classes focus on open-ended projects, i.e.,
students can choose whatever projects they want.  This means that you
can use your research as part of your course projects, which means you
can commit more time doing <i>in-depth</i> research.  Breadth and
depth will be good for your resume.



<h2>Logistics</h2>

<p><b>Supervision:</b> You will be supervised mainly by me and/or
my senior PhD students.  We
will meet weekly or bi-weekly.

<p><b>First step:</b> Using systems is easy. Understanding
systems is not that straightforward.  Improving systems is
harder.  In our life, most of the time, we are only a user.  Now,
you need to understand what's going on behind the scene.  We will
give you concrete directions to help you understand complex
systems.  Don't be afraid to get lost in the middle -- it is our
responsibility to guide you through.  Roughly, you should expect
to spend the first month only for understanding how
systems work.  The following months will be more fun (and
hopefully you have new findings).

<p><b>Independent:</b> Although we will provide guidance, you are
also expected to be highly independent and self-motivated.  That
is, for every problem you will face, you should try to find the
answer yourself (that's why it's called research).  Although,
often the time we want to get to the result quickly, research is
not always like that.  Hence this will be a powerful process that
hopefully shapes you for grad school.  In fact, good student also
educates the advisor about what he/she finds.  This will be a
two-way learning process.




<h2>How to apply?</h2>

<p>First, sit back, relax, and <b>think hard</b> about this.  Ask yourself
whether you can commit that many hours in the next four quarters or
beyond (again, research should not be a "side thing").  Don't just
think that "research is cool, and I need to have that in my resume"
but you have no planning to allocate time for research.  Please do not
proceed if at the end you cannot take research seriously (due to
overcommitment).
