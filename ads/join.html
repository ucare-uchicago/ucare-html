with my students via Skype (e.g., if I have quick notes or instructions).



<h2>Reading List</h2>

<p>[Only do this if Haryadi tells you so. Otherwise you can skip for now.]

<p><li>Please visit <b>UCARE reading list</b> 
(<a href="http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/readings/">http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/readings</a>. 
Please read the README file first.  Haryadi will tell you
what reading is necessary for your project.

<p>Here's a required reading list depending on your research project.
If you work on project related to:
<ul>

<li>Cloud computing, then read <b>s-cloudos.html (Data-Center Stack section)</b>.
<br>(Minimally, you should understand the basic 
architecture/functionalities of GoogleFS/HDFS, MapReduce/Hadoop,
BigTable/HBase, Dynamo/Cassandra)

<li>File/storage systems, then read <b>s-cloudos.html (File System 101 section)</b>.
<li>SSD, then read <b>s-ssd.html (SSD 101)</b>.
</ul>

<li>(Note that if you feel you don't have a strong systems background,
then you need to self-learn Operating System concepts.
Please go through the materials in 
<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">OSTEP free book</a>
(every chapter).  This is a very short direct-to-the-point book, so
you should be able to absorb things quickly.  You don't have to
memorize everything. As long as you understand the concepts, it's good
enough -- in the future if you need to go deep, you know which chapter
to look for.  When you reach the persistence chapters, make sure you
digest things slowly).


<p><li>Finally, make sure you read <b>UCARE publications</b> related to your project.  
Our publications can be found here:
<a href="http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/pubs.html">http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/pubs.html</a>.
If you have detailed questions about some of the papers, please talk directly to the
student authors.


<h2>Optional:</h2>

(Only if I ask you to do so).

<p><li><a href="https://www.chameleoncloud.org/">Sign up to Chameleon Cloud</a>.
If I ask you to join Emulab, you should click the
link.  This cloud will allow you to do bare metal access, installing your own
Linux.  Please find a PhD student in our group who has used Chameleon and
tell that Haryadi asks you to connect to them.

<p><li><a href="https://www.emulab.net/reqaccount.php3">Sign up to
Emulab.</a>  If I ask you to join Emulab, you should click the
link, and for the project name, either use "ucare" or "cs331-uc" or both (I'll 
let you know).   [Chameleon should be enough, but just in case you need
network emulation, you shoudl use Emulab].

Then go to <a href="https://wiki.emulab.net/Emulab/wiki">Emulab wiki</a>,
and read FAQ, Getting Started tutorial, Virtual Nodes. (You can skim the
rest of the documents)

<p><li>If your English proficiency is still weak, especially
in articulating technical materials, you should seriously
<a href="https://wiki.uchicago.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=122520169">do this practice</a>
(only accesible from uchicago email address).
