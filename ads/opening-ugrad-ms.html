<h1>Undergraduate and Master Research in  
<br>Cloud Computing and Operating/Storage Systems</h1>


<p>
Our research group is currently recruiting undergraduate and master
students who would like to get strong experience in <b>systems
research</b> in the area of Cloud Computing and Operating/Storage
Systems.  In this project, students will learn about exciting
technology running behind large Internet services at Google,
Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Yahoo!, and Amazon.

<p>Students who participate in our projects and perform well 
will become co-authors in our publications.
