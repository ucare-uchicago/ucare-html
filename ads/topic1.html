<h2 class=redbox>Building Dependable Cloud Computing (Multiple Sub-Projects) </h2>

<p>The last decade has seen a rise of open-source distributed systems such
as Hadoop, HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, and ZooKeeper, that are based on new
technologies behind Internet-scale companies, technologies such as Google
MapReduce, Google File System, Google Big Table, Google Chubby, Amazon
Dynamo Key-Value Store, and Facebook Haystack Photo Store.


<P>
These cloud-scale distributed systems have become an increasingly
important software backbone for many cloud services today.  
They are used by many other large companies such as 
Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, and many others.
Their dependability in terms of performance, scalability, 
availability, and
reliability is very crucial.  Nevertheless, distributed systems are
complex and hard to get right.  These systems face all sorts of issues
[See Cloud Bug Study (CBS) and Cloud Outage Study (COS) papers below].

<P>
We have the following sub-projects.  Each student will be given a
sub-project.
<P>
1. Combating <b>distributed concurrency bugs</b>: You will intregate model checking tools
to datacenter distributed systems and invent new policies to speed up the process.
<P>
2. Combating <b>scalability bugs</b>: You will analyze new unique bugs
specific to scalability, e.g., complex bugs that create problems when
systems are deployed at scale.
<P>
3. Combating <b>outage bugs</b>: You will analyze bugs that can shut down
an entire cluster (e.g. Affect all the machines in the cluster). These
bugs typically cause major outages.
<P>
4. Combating <b>cross-system bugs</b>: Today many cloud systems depend
on each other (e.g. HBase depends on ZooKeeper and HDFS). 
You will analyze bugs that can cause downtime. 
<P>
5. Combating <b>performance bugs</b>: You will analyze the interaction of
cloud systems with the Operating System layer (file systems in
particular) and analyze tail latencies in cloud systems.

Other notes:</h3>
<P>
- We recruit multiple students for this project
<P>
- Students who deliver an excellent progress will be co-authors of our
publications (as some previous students have successfully done in the
past).
<P>
- Students will be paired with PhD students who are currently
working on the sub-projects above.  
<P>
- More info about our group can be found here:

<P>
<H3>Deliverables</h3>
<P>
- There are three steps in this research: analyze, build, and evaluate
<P>
- Analyze: Each student will work on a cloud system (Hadoop, HDFS,
HBase, or Cassandra).  The student will download, install, and run the
given system on distributed machines.  The student will study the
source code and perform some benchmarking.
<P>
- Build: The student will modify the given cloud system.  (Usually we
expect a minimum of 2000 LOC changes, but usually it's more).  The
modification depends on your result from the "Analyze" phase.  
<P>
- Evaluate: You will extend the existing testing suites and show that
you have improved the scalability/performance/reliability/availability
of your given system.

<P>
<H3>Prerequisites </h3>
<P>
- Must be expert in Java (our target systems are all in Java)
<P>
- C/C++ might help
<p>
- Good with scripting languages (bash, csh, etc.)
