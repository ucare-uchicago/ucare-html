Welcome to research.  Your first task is to select project areas, by reading our papers and find the ones you're interested more.

The papers can be found in the following links:

http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/pubs.html
and
http://ucare.cs.uchicago.edu/insubm.html

There are 4 project areas:

a) OS research
Please read: MittOS

b) SSD research
Please read: Tiny-Tail Flash, FEMU, The Tail at Store

c) Scalability and outage related bugs
Please read: Scalability bugs, SCk, Why does the cloud stop computing?, PBSE.

d) Concurrency bugs in distributed systems
Please read: TaxDC, SAMC, DeepMC


Please do read **all** the papers above, so that you know which ones you like. Don't just read the papers in the areas you want. Sometimes you don't know what you like until you read the papers.

Reading papers must be done slowly (and sometimes you need to read the paper twice to get the idea).  Focus on the introduction and high-level solutions. It's okay for you to not understand the entire paper.

I'll give you a month to decice, and ping me back again then.

Please respond by saying:

"I'm interested in area(s) of _____________"

You can pick one, some, or all (don't care).

For example:
"I'm interested in areas of
(a) OS research, or
(b) Scalability and outage related bugs"

(At the end, I'll have the final say of what your project will be :)
But it's good for me to know your desired areas.

Thanks,
-- Har
