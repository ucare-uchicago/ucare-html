# DOWNLOAD PAPERS
# ---------------

The "links" on the reading list does not work. 
They point to my notes on my laptop.  

To download the pdf of the paper, just go to google.com and search the
paper title.

You should be able to find the pdfs publicly accessible.  If there is an
important reading that is not publicly available, try accessing that via
campus (usually some papers are accessible because the university already
pays ACM/IEEE).  If all of the above don't work, please ask UCARE students
to fetch it for you.
